# justfile — livespec-impl-beads dev-tooling task runner.

# Generated from livespec/templates/impl-plugin/justfile.jinja at

# Authority: livespec/SPECIFICATION/non-functional-requirements.md
#   §"Enforcement-suite invocation" — `just` is the canonical entry
#   point for every dev-tooling invocation. Lefthook and CI MUST
#   delegate to `just <target>`; direct tool invocations are banned
#   (enforced by livespec_dev_tooling.checks.no_direct_tool_invocation).

# Authority: livespec/SPECIFICATION/contracts.md
#   §"Pre-commit step ordering" — the gates wired here mirror the
#   spec-required ordering: 00-lint-autofix-staged, 01-commit-pairs-
#   source-and-test, 02-check-pre-commit at pre-commit;
#   no-commit-on-master + red-green-replay at commit-msg; full
#   aggregate (with zero-py subsetting) at pre-push.

# Authority: livespec/SPECIFICATION/contracts.md
#   §"Shared code sync — livespec-dev-tooling" (v094 wiring-
#   completeness invariant) — every canonical slug emitted by
#   `livespec_dev_tooling.canonical_checks` MUST be wired in this
#   `check:` aggregate in alphabetical order; livespec-impl-beads-
#   private extras MAY follow after the canonical block. The in-repo
#   gate `check-aggregate-completeness` enforces this on every run.

# `skip` — space-separated list of `check:` targets to omit from a single run.
# Default empty (full aggregate). Overridden on the command line by the Red-mode
# pre-commit hook (see check-pre-commit). When empty, the green token is written

# Jinja extension registered in `copier.yml`. Per

# the dev-tooling sibling repo, then re-running `copier update --vcs-ref=master` here.

# ---------------------------------------------------------------

# Run the CLI end-to-end harness against this plugin's own per-skill
# fixtures (per livespec/SPECIFICATION/contracts.md §"CLI end-to-end
# harness contract"). The harness ships from livespec-dev-tooling
# (v0.8.0) and is consumed via the imported test_workflow_full_round_
# trip entry point wired in tests/e2e-cli/. Defaults to the MOCK tier
# (LIVESPEC_E2E_HARNESS=mock — the one mocked boundary is the
# `claude -p` subprocess; real install-shape setup, real structural
# skill discovery, the real fail-closed time-bomb coverage gate, and
# the real per-skill orchestration loop all run). The fail-closed
# coverage gate raises CoverageGateError when a `/livespec-impl-
# beads:*` skill lacks a fixture, failing this target. The CI
# `e2e-cli` job delegates here (no direct tool invocation in the
# workflow). The mock-tier test ALSO runs as part of the normal suite
# under check-per-file-coverage; this target is the dedicated,
# explicitly-named tier entry point CI reports as its own status.
