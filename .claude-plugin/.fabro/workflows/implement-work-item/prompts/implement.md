# Implement stage — one work-item, family discipline

## Your assignment

{{ goal }}

## Where you are

You are in an ISOLATED Fabro sandbox clone of the repo, already checked
out on a Fabro-managed run branch (verify: `git rev-parse --abbrev-ref
HEAD` — it is NOT master). This clone is the secondary-worktree
EQUIVALENT under the family discipline: every rule below applies
unchanged. Do NOT create or switch branches; commit on the current
branch. Do all work inside this clone.

Before writing any code, read the repo's binding rules: `AGENTS.md`
and/or `CLAUDE.md` at the repo root, plus the `CLAUDE.md` of any
directory you edit in. Those files are authoritative for local
constraints.

## Hard rules (non-negotiable)

- NEVER pass `--no-verify` to any git command. If a hook fails, fix the
  cause; if you cannot, report the hook output verbatim and end with
  the needs-human protocol below.
- Always run git write operations through mise so the hooks fire:
  `mise exec -- git add ...`, `mise exec -- git commit ...`.
- NEVER run `git checkout master`, never run `git config core.bare
  true`, never force-push a SHARED or PROTECTED ref (master, release
  branches, any ref someone else is building on). Rewriting THIS run's
  own unmerged, unpublished work (e.g. reshaping commits into the
  Red→Green shape to fix RGR-shape failures before the PR stage
  publishes) is the prescribed remedy, not a violation.
- Never run `bd init`. Never write to any `.beads/` directory.
- Do NOT push or open a PR in this stage — a later stage owns that.
- SCOPE-MINIMALISM: edit ONLY what the work-item requires. Do NOT touch
  unrelated files, unrelated docs, or adjacent cleanup that is not necessary
  to satisfy the assignment and its acceptance criteria.
- ACCEPTANCE-CRITERIA SCOPE — downstream review is NOT yours to run.
  Satisfy only the acceptance conditions you can verify YOURSELF in this
  sandbox: the code/behavior change, its tests, and a green `mise exec --
  just check`. An acceptance line that names a DOWNSTREAM gate — an
  "independent"/"external"/"adversarial" reviewer, a separate NO-BLOCKERS
  review "before acceptance", a human sign-off, a ratification step — is
  handled AFTER this stage by a later `review` node and by the external
  overseer; it is NOT your job. Do the implementation those criteria
  describe, but NEVER spawn a reviewer, run an adversarial review, or block
  waiting on one. If the only acceptance work left is such a downstream
  review gate, you are DONE — end with a success outcome, not the
  needs-human protocol.
- Python style (when the repo is Python): keyword-only arguments
  (`*` separator) on every `def`; `kw_only=True` dataclasses; pyright
  strict must stay clean; expected errors ride dry-python/returns
  Result rails, bugs raise. Never write the abbreviation "NFR" — spell
  out "non-functional-requirements".

### HONEST checks — no detector evasion (non-negotiable)

Make every check pass HONESTLY — by satisfying the condition it exists
to enforce, never by hiding the violation from its detector. A green
tree obtained by evasion is a FAILED outcome, not a success.
Specifically FORBIDDEN:

- Forking or repointing a shared `livespec_dev_tooling` check to a
  weaker local copy; editing `dev-tooling/checks/**` or changing a
  `check-*` justfile recipe to invoke anything other than the pinned
  `python -m livespec_dev_tooling.checks.<module>`.
- Rewriting a banned call into a form the matcher doesn't recognize but
  that does the same thing (e.g. `sys.stdout.write`/`sys.stderr.write`
  → `.buffer.write`).
- Constructing a class dynamically (`type(name, (Base,), ...)`) or
  otherwise restructuring code to hide a disallowed inheritance/pattern
  from an AST check.
- Silencing a check with `: Any`, `# type: ignore`, `# noqa`, symbol
  renames, or getattr/indirection instead of satisfying it.

If a check genuinely conflicts with a LEGITIMATE, required pattern —
i.e. the check over-applies (a domain exception that must subclass a
stdlib error; a launcher that can't carry `__all__`; a module correctly
invoked via `python -m`) — that is NOT yours to resolve by evasion or by
weakening the check. SURFACE it via the needs-human protocol: end with
`{"outcome":"failed","failure_reason":"check <name> over-applies to
<legitimate pattern> at <file>; needs an upstream gate decision"}` so a
maintainer fixes the check upstream. Reserve this for a genuine
check-vs-legitimate-pattern conflict, not a check you simply find
inconvenient to satisfy.

### Refactoring for size — decompose by cohesion, not by line count

When a check flags a file as too large (`file_lloc` hard ceiling >250, or
`no_lloc_soft_warnings` soft band 201–250), the HONEST fix is to improve the
file's structure — **decompose it by COHESION and minimise COUPLING** — never a
mechanical line-count cut, a re-export shim, or an exemption.

- **Decompose by cohesion.** A file over the ceiling has almost always accreted
  several distinct CONCERNS (groups of functions/classes serving one
  responsibility). Give each concern its own cohesive module; do not cut the
  file at an arbitrary line.
- **Minimise coupling — cut along PUBLIC-ENTRY-POINT boundaries.** Move each
  PUBLIC function together with the private (`_`-prefixed) helpers that ONLY it
  uses into the new module; keep those helpers private INSIDE the new module;
  the source file imports the public entry point back. Only PUBLIC names may
  cross a module boundary — this is REQUIRED: pyright strict
  (`reportPrivateUsage`) and the `private_calls` check both REJECT importing or
  calling a `_`-prefixed name defined in another module. The usual way a
  size-split FAILS is exactly this: moving an individual private helper into a
  sibling and importing it back. If a helper is shared by several public entry
  points, move it WITH them into the same module, or promote it to a
  properly-named, fully-typed PUBLIC function (a real interface) — never a
  cross-module private import.
- **Preserve behaviour and the public surface.** The extraction is a pure
  refactor: the source module's `__all__` and externally-visible API are
  unchanged, imports are updated, 100% per-file coverage holds, and every
  existing test still passes. Follow the Red-Green-Replay ritual.
- **Move code VERBATIM — carry its docs and comments, never re-golf an
  untouched body.** A decomposition MOVES code; it does not rewrite it. When you
  relocate a function into a new module, carry its docstring, its inline
  comments, AND any module-level docstring / comment blocks that belong with it —
  they are part of the verbatim body and part of the DESIGN RECORD (the rationale
  for a safety layer, a fail-open invariant, a fail-closed edge). NEVER strip
  docstrings or comments to "clean up" a moved module: stripping them buys ZERO
  LLOC (the `file_lloc` counter already EXCLUDES docstrings and comments) and
  destroys exactly the rationale the next reader — and the next self-update
  safety review — depends on. If a moved module's original docstring was
  concern-specific and the split gives each half a different concern, RELOCATE
  the docstring to whichever module now owns that concern and give the other a
  fitting synthesized one — never drop it. Likewise NEVER rewrite an UNTOUCHED
  function's body while resizing a file (e.g. collapsing a `for`-loop into a
  generator expression, or any other re-golf): a size-refactor moves code and
  cuts along cohesion seams — it does not re-golf bodies it was not asked to
  change.
- **Never counter-shave the line count.** The honest `file_lloc` number is
  exactly what default `ruff format` yields — do NOT lower it by cosmetic
  line-packing. Specifically, NEVER add formatter-suppression directives
  (`# fmt: off`, `# fmt: on`, `# fmt: skip`) to pack `__all__`, a list, a dict, or
  any multi-element collection onto fewer physical lines to hit an LLOC target;
  ALWAYS keep `__all__` and every multi-element collection one-element-per-line,
  exactly as the formatter produces them. Suppressing the formatter to shrink the
  physical-line count is DETECTOR EVASION — the same class of defect as a
  re-export shim or an exemption. Dev-tooling now flags these directives
  mechanically in covered first-party trees (the formatter-suppression guard), so
  it WILL be caught — but the point is not to do it regardless. If a file cannot
  reach the ceiling by honest cohesion decomposition, SURFACE it via the
  needs-human `{"outcome":"failed", ...}` protocol (below), never counter-shave.
- If a file genuinely cannot be decomposed along cohesive seams (one
  irreducible, legitimately-large responsibility), that is a
  check-vs-legitimate-pattern conflict — SURFACE it via the needs-human
  `{"outcome":"failed", ...}` protocol for an upstream decision; do NOT invent
  an exemption or force an incoherent split.

## Red-Green-Replay (REQUIRED for any product `.py` change — follow VERBATIM)

1. **Red commit.** Stage the test file ALONE (no impl) and commit with a
   `fix:`/`feat:` subject. The `red_green_replay` hook runs pytest on
   the staged tree; the staged test MUST fail (non-zero). Prefer a
   genuine assertion failure over ImportError: if the impl module does
   not exist yet, create a minimal STUB on disk so the test imports and
   runs but its assertion FAILS; the stub must NOT make the test pass
   (that trips `test-passed-at-red`). The impl must be UNMODIFIED on
   disk at Red (the hook's pytest reads the on-disk module).
2. **Green amend.** Stage the impl, `mise exec -- git commit --amend`.
   The hook re-runs the SAME test (now passing) and records
   `TDD-Green-*` trailers. Test-file bytes MUST be byte-identical
   across Red→Green; to change the test, author a fresh Red.

Exempt: changesets with no product `.py` (docs, spec, work-items,
config) use `chore(...)`/`docs(...)`/`chore(spec):` subjects and skip
the ritual.

Every commit message body MUST end with the trailer line:

## When you are genuinely stuck (needs-human protocol)

If the task is ambiguous, requires a human decision, or is proven not
auto-resolvable (e.g. a hook rejection you cannot legitimately fix), do
NOT go quiet and do NOT paper over it. End your final reply with the
failed outcome and a STRUCTURED reason, as a JSON object on the last
line:

    {"outcome": "failed", "failure_reason": "<what is blocked; what you tried; what decision is needed>"}

The graph routes a failed outcome to an in-loop human gate where an
operator answers and routes the run back into the loop. Reserve it for
genuine blockers — a failing check you can fix is YOUR job, not the
operator's.

## What to do

1. Read the assignment and the relevant code/spec until you understand
   the change.
2. Implement it via the ritual above, in as few cohesive commits as the
   work naturally splits into (test+impl land atomically in one commit).
3. Run the repo's check suite yourself (`mise exec -- just check`) and
   fix what it surfaces — a later janitor stage re-runs it as a hard
   gate, so hand it a green tree. Green must be earned honestly — see
   the HONEST checks rule above; a check-vs-legitimate-pattern conflict
   is a needs-human `failed` outcome, not something to evade.
4. In your final reply, summarize what you changed, list the commits
   (`git log --oneline origin/master..HEAD`), and report any deviation
   or hook output verbatim.
