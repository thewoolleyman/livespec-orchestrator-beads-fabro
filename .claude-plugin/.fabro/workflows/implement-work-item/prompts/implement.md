# Implement stage — one work-item, family discipline

## Test-first assertion loop — start here

The complete work-item goal is in the Fabro-injected `Goal:` preamble
above. Read the repository binding rules named below, then execute this
loop once for EACH gradeable acceptance assertion, in order:

1. Pick exactly one acceptance assertion.
2. Write one failing test for that assertion. Run that test and observe
   it fail on a genuine assertion, not at collection or import time.
3. Red-commit that test alone.
4. While HEAD is that open Red, write the minimum product implementation
   that makes the assertion pass, run the test, and Green-amend the Red.
5. Repeat from step 1 for the next assertion. One assertion gets one
   observable Red-Green cycle.

Product-write order is mechanical: no product file may be created or
modified before the first Red commit, and every later product write
requires HEAD to be an open Red. The ONLY carveout is a new-module
failing stub: after its test is written and still uncommitted, a product
file that does not exist at HEAD may be created with the minimum surface
needed to import and reach the assertion. The stub must make that
assertion FAIL; it must never satisfy it. Modifying an existing product
file outside an open Red is never part of this carveout.

## Where you are

You are in an ISOLATED Fabro sandbox clone of the repo, already checked
out on a Fabro-managed run branch (verify: `git rev-parse --abbrev-ref
HEAD` — it is NOT `{{ inputs.default_branch }}`). This clone is the secondary-worktree
EQUIVALENT under the family discipline: every rule below applies
unchanged. Do NOT create or switch branches; commit on the current
branch. Do all work inside this clone.

Before writing any code, read the repo's binding rules: `AGENTS.md`
and/or `CLAUDE.md` at the repo root, plus the `CLAUDE.md` of any
directory you edit in. Those files are authoritative for local
constraints.

## Hard rules (non-negotiable)

- NEVER pass `--no-verify` to any git command. If a hook fails, fix the
  cause; if you cannot, report the hook output verbatim and end with
  the needs-human protocol below.
- Git write operations (`git add ...`, `git commit ...`) fire the
  repository's installed hooks — the sandbox's prepare chain installed
  them and the hook body resolves its own tooling. Let them fire.
- NEVER run `git checkout {{ inputs.default_branch }}`, never run `git config core.bare
  true`, never force-push a SHARED or PROTECTED ref ({{ inputs.default_branch }}, release
  branches, any ref someone else is building on). Rewriting THIS run's
  own unmerged, unpublished work (e.g. reshaping commits into the
  Red→Green shape to fix RGR-shape failures before the PR stage
  publishes) is the prescribed remedy, not a violation.
- Never run `bd init`. Never write to any `.beads/` directory.
- Do NOT push or open a PR in this stage — a later stage owns that.
- SCOPE-MINIMALISM: edit ONLY what the work-item requires. Do NOT touch
  unrelated files, unrelated docs, or adjacent cleanup that is not necessary
  to satisfy the assignment and its acceptance criteria.
- ACCEPTANCE-CRITERIA SCOPE — downstream review is NOT yours to run.
  Satisfy only the acceptance conditions you can verify YOURSELF in this
  sandbox: the code/behavior change, its tests, and a green run of the
  repository's check suite (`{{ inputs.sandbox_check_suite }}`). An acceptance line that names a DOWNSTREAM gate — an
  "independent"/"external"/"adversarial" reviewer, a separate NO-BLOCKERS
  review "before acceptance", a human sign-off, a ratification step — is
  handled AFTER this stage by a later `review` node and by the external
  overseer; it is NOT your job. Do the implementation those criteria
  describe, but NEVER spawn a reviewer, run an adversarial review, or block
  waiting on one. If the only acceptance work left is such a downstream
  review gate, you are DONE — end with a success outcome, not the
  needs-human protocol.
- Python style (when the repo is Python): keyword-only arguments
  (`*` separator) on every `def`; `kw_only=True` dataclasses; pyright
  strict must stay clean; expected errors ride dry-python/returns
  Result rails, bugs raise. Never write the abbreviation "NFR" — spell
  out "non-functional-requirements".

### HONEST checks — no detector evasion (non-negotiable)

Make every check pass HONESTLY — by satisfying the condition it exists
to enforce, never by hiding the violation from its detector. A green
tree obtained by evasion is a FAILED outcome, not a success.
Specifically FORBIDDEN:

- Forking or repointing a shared, externally-owned check (the fleet's
  dev-tooling Verifiers the prepare chain installed) to a weaker local copy;
  editing `dev-tooling/checks/**` or changing a `check-*` justfile recipe to
  invoke anything other than the pinned shared check module.
- Rewriting a banned call into a form the matcher doesn't recognize but
  that does the same thing (e.g. `sys.stdout.write`/`sys.stderr.write`
  → `.buffer.write`).
- Constructing a class dynamically (`type(name, (Base,), ...)`) or
  otherwise restructuring code to hide a disallowed inheritance/pattern
  from an AST check.
- Silencing a check with `: Any`, `# type: ignore`, `# noqa`, symbol
  renames, or getattr/indirection instead of satisfying it.

If a check genuinely conflicts with a LEGITIMATE, required pattern —
i.e. the check over-applies (a domain exception that must subclass a
stdlib error; a launcher that can't carry `__all__`; a module correctly
invoked via `python -m`) — that is NOT yours to resolve by evasion or by
weakening the check. SURFACE it via the needs-human protocol: end with
`{"outcome":"failed","failure_reason":"check <name> over-applies to
<legitimate pattern> at <file>; needs an upstream gate decision"}` so a
maintainer fixes the check upstream. Reserve this for a genuine
check-vs-legitimate-pattern conflict, not a check you simply find
inconvenient to satisfy.

### Refactoring for size — decompose by cohesion, not by line count

When a check flags a file as too large (`file_lloc` hard ceiling >250, or
`no_lloc_soft_warnings` soft band 201–250), the HONEST fix is to improve the
file's structure — **decompose it by COHESION and minimise COUPLING** — never a
mechanical line-count cut, a re-export shim, or an exemption.

- **Decompose by cohesion.** A file over the ceiling has almost always accreted
  several distinct CONCERNS (groups of functions/classes serving one
  responsibility). Give each concern its own cohesive module; do not cut the
  file at an arbitrary line.
- **Minimise coupling — cut along PUBLIC-ENTRY-POINT boundaries.** Move each
  PUBLIC function together with the private (`_`-prefixed) helpers that ONLY it
  uses into the new module; keep those helpers private INSIDE the new module;
  the source file imports the public entry point back. Only PUBLIC names may
  cross a module boundary — this is REQUIRED: pyright strict
  (`reportPrivateUsage`) and the `private_calls` check both REJECT importing or
  calling a `_`-prefixed name defined in another module. The usual way a
  size-split FAILS is exactly this: moving an individual private helper into a
  sibling and importing it back. If a helper is shared by several public entry
  points, move it WITH them into the same module, or promote it to a
  properly-named, fully-typed PUBLIC function (a real interface) — never a
  cross-module private import.
- **Preserve behaviour and the public surface.** The extraction is a pure
  refactor: the source module's `__all__` and externally-visible API are
  unchanged, imports are updated, 100% per-file coverage holds, and every
  existing test still passes. Follow the Red-Green-Replay ritual.
- **Move code VERBATIM — carry its docs and comments, never re-golf an
  untouched body.** A decomposition MOVES code; it does not rewrite it. When you
  relocate a function into a new module, carry its docstring, its inline
  comments, AND any module-level docstring / comment blocks that belong with it —
  they are part of the verbatim body and part of the DESIGN RECORD (the rationale
  for a safety layer, a fail-open invariant, a fail-closed edge). NEVER strip
  docstrings or comments to "clean up" a moved module: stripping them buys ZERO
  LLOC (the `file_lloc` counter already EXCLUDES docstrings and comments) and
  destroys exactly the rationale the next reader — and the next self-update
  safety review — depends on. If a moved module's original docstring was
  concern-specific and the split gives each half a different concern, RELOCATE
  the docstring to whichever module now owns that concern and give the other a
  fitting synthesized one — never drop it. Likewise NEVER rewrite an UNTOUCHED
  function's body while resizing a file (e.g. collapsing a `for`-loop into a
  generator expression, or any other re-golf): a size-refactor moves code and
  cuts along cohesion seams — it does not re-golf bodies it was not asked to
  change.
- **Never counter-shave the line count.** The honest `file_lloc` number is
  exactly what default `ruff format` yields — do NOT lower it by cosmetic
  line-packing. Specifically, NEVER add formatter-suppression directives
  (`# fmt: off`, `# fmt: on`, `# fmt: skip`) to pack `__all__`, a list, a dict, or
  any multi-element collection onto fewer physical lines to hit an LLOC target;
  ALWAYS keep `__all__` and every multi-element collection one-element-per-line,
  exactly as the formatter produces them. Suppressing the formatter to shrink the
  physical-line count is DETECTOR EVASION — the same class of defect as a
  re-export shim or an exemption. Dev-tooling now flags these directives
  mechanically in covered first-party trees (the formatter-suppression guard), so
  it WILL be caught — but the point is not to do it regardless. If a file cannot
  reach the ceiling by honest cohesion decomposition, SURFACE it via the
  needs-human `{"outcome":"failed", ...}` protocol (below), never counter-shave.
- If a file genuinely cannot be decomposed along cohesive seams (one
  irreducible, legitimately-large responsibility), that is a
  check-vs-legitimate-pattern conflict — SURFACE it via the needs-human
  `{"outcome":"failed", ...}` protocol for an upstream decision; do NOT invent
  an exemption or force an incoherent split.

## Red-Green-Replay (REQUIRED for any product `.py` change — follow VERBATIM)

1. **Red commit.** Stage the test file ALONE (no impl) and commit with a
   `fix:`/`feat:` subject. The `red_green_replay` hook runs pytest on
   the staged tree; the staged test MUST fail (non-zero). Prefer a
   genuine assertion failure over ImportError: if the impl module does
   not exist yet, use the new-module failing-stub carveout above so the
   test imports and runs but its assertion FAILS; the stub must NOT make
   the test pass (that trips `test-passed-at-red`). Every existing
   product file must be UNMODIFIED on disk at Red (the hook's pytest
   reads the on-disk module).
   - **A COLLECTION ERROR IS NOT AN ACCEPTABLE RED.** If the staged test
     dies at COLLECTION (e.g. a top-level `import <new_module>` that does
     not exist yet → `ModuleNotFoundError`, zero assertions run), the Red
     proves only unimportability, NOT that the behavior is unimplemented —
     it is a FAKE Red even though the hook accepts a non-zero exit. Never
     describe such a Red as "genuine-assertion" in the PR body.
   - **Decomposition / new-module slices — use the importlib pattern (NOT a
     top-level import).** When the test asserts that code moved INTO a new
     module, do NOT `import <new_module>` at module top (that makes the Red
     a collection error). Instead: put the module import INSIDE the test
     body via `importlib.import_module(...)`, and make the FIRST assertion
     a genuine check that fails before the import — e.g.
     `assert module_path.is_file()` on the new module's expected path, then
     (after import) assert the new public names exist AND the old private
     names are GONE from the source module. At Red the file does not exist
     yet, so `is_file()` fails as a genuine assertion; at Green it passes.
     This is the established pattern the prior decomposition slices used —
     follow it verbatim for any "extract to a new module" change.
2. **Green amend.** Stage the impl, `git commit --amend`.
   The hook re-runs the SAME test (now passing) and records
   `TDD-Green-*` trailers. Test-file bytes MUST be byte-identical
   across Red→Green; to change the test, author a fresh Red.

Exempt: changesets with no product `.py` (docs, spec, work-items,
config) use `chore(...)`/`docs(...)`/`chore(spec):` subjects and skip
the ritual.

Every commit message body MUST end with the trailer line:

## The Definition of Done is the brief — amend it, never work around it

The work-item's `## Definition of Done` section, exactly as it reached
you in the `Goal:` preamble, is the statement the proof stages capture
against and the post-merge acceptance pass grades against. It is read
from the dispatch-time snapshot, so editing the ledger mid-run cannot
change what this run is graded on.

This run MUST NOT deliver behaviour that differs from the Definition of
Done it was dispatched with. When you determine that the section is
wrong or incomplete — an assertion that cannot be satisfied as written,
one that contradicts the item's own title or description, a missing
assertion the work plainly needs, or an assertion whose proof mode is
wrong (you MUST NOT change a proof mode yourself) — do NOT widen the
work to cover what you think it meant, do NOT narrow it to what you can
deliver, and do NOT edit the section: the Definition of Done is the
human's.

End the run through the structured needs-human ending below, carrying
the proposed amendment as the failure reason — the assertion as
dispatched, what is wrong with it, and the exact replacement text you
propose:

    {"outcome": "failed", "failure_reason": "Definition of Done amendment for <work-item id>: <the assertion as dispatched> — <what is wrong with it> — proposed replacement: <the text that should stand>"}

Publish no code that differs from the section. A run that ends this way
preserves its tree by reference and publishes nothing for merge; the
item rests at `blocked / needs-human` with your amendment as the
recorded question, and the human edits the ledger and releases it with
`resolve-blocked:<work-item id>:ready`. This is the ONE rest state for a
wrong Definition of Done, whichever stage notices it — the `dod_gate`
node that graded the section before you ran takes exactly the same
route.

## When you are genuinely stuck (needs-human protocol)

If the task is ambiguous, requires a human decision, or is proven not
auto-resolvable (e.g. a hook rejection you cannot legitimately fix), do
NOT go quiet and do NOT paper over it. End your final reply with the
failed outcome and a STRUCTURED reason, as a JSON object on the last
line:

    {"outcome": "failed", "failure_reason": "<what is blocked; what you tried; what decision is needed>"}

The graph routes a failed outcome to a terminal `needs_human` node: the
run preserves your tree on a run-scoped ref and ends, and the work-item
rests in the ledger at `blocked / needs-human` until a human decides
(re-dispatch from the preserved ref, from scratch, or leave it). No run
waits for that answer. Reserve it for
genuine blockers — a failing check you can fix is YOUR job, not the
operator's.

## Finish the run

After every acceptance assertion has completed its own loop:

1. Run the repo's check suite yourself (`{{ inputs.sandbox_check_suite }}`) and
   fix what it surfaces — a later janitor stage re-runs it as a hard
   gate, so hand it a green tree. Green must be earned honestly — see
   the HONEST checks rule above; a check-vs-legitimate-pattern conflict
   is a needs-human `failed` outcome, not something to evade.
2. In your final reply, summarize what you changed, list the commits
   (`git log --oneline origin/{{ inputs.default_branch }}..HEAD`), and report any deviation
   or hook output verbatim.

## Ending the turn — leave nothing running in the background

The ACP turn this stage runs inside cannot COMPLETE while the agent
session still has work outstanding, so anything you leave running holds
the turn open until the node's own timeout kills it — and work that had
already finished is then recorded as a timed-out stage instead of the
green result it was. Measured repeatedly on this factory: stages that had
already emitted their final message sat idle for 28, 75 and 89 minutes
before the ceiling fired, and four further runs were lost in one night to
a single backgrounded command.

So, in this stage:

- NEVER background a tool call. Do not pass `run_in_background` (or any
  other detach flag) to a shell tool, and do not start a poller, a
  watcher, a `tail -f`, or a loop that waits for a condition.
- Run a long command in the FOREGROUND and raise THAT call's own timeout
  instead. A full check suite, a dependency install, or a long
  verification wait belongs in ONE blocking call whose output you read,
  never in a background job you poll.
- If something IS still running when you are ready to finish, STOP it
  before your final message (`TaskStop`, `KillShell`, or whatever kills
  what you started) and confirm it is gone.
- Your final message must be the LAST thing the turn does. Do not start
  any new tool call, probe, or cleanup after it.
