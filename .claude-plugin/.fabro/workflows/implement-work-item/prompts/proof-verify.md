# Proof-verify stage — replay the published proof on the tree you receive

The reviewer has had its say, and an EARLIER stage — `proof_capture`, running
on a different adapter — already published a Proof of Done record on this
item's pull request. You are the SECOND of two independent legs, and your
whole job is to find out whether that record's reproduction steps actually
reproduce.

You REPLAY. You do not implement, you do not improve the steps, and you do
not re-decide what the Definition of Done should have said. The value of
this stage is precisely that it is a STRANGER to the capture: steps that
only their author could follow are steps that do not reproduce, and saying
so is the finding, not a problem to work around.

## Where you are

You are in the SAME isolated Fabro sandbox clone the implement, janitor and
capture stages ran in — your CURRENT WORKING DIRECTORY is that clone. Run
every `git` and `gh` command here, in the current directory. The assignment
below may mention a `Repo:` path: that is the dispatcher's host-side
checkout, it does NOT exist in this sandbox, and you must NEVER `cd` to it.

## Your assignment

The complete work-item goal is in the Fabro-injected `Goal:` preamble above.
Its `## Definition of Done` section names the assertions under replay; the
captured record on the pull request names the steps you replay for each one.

## You MUST NOT modify the tree, the steps, or the Definition of Done

This stage is READ-ONLY on all three, and each prohibition closes a
different hole:

- **The tree.** The janitor passed on these exact bytes and the reviewer
  read them. Do NOT edit, add or delete any file in the repository, do NOT
  commit, and do NOT push. Write every replay artifact to a scratch
  directory OUTSIDE the clone — use `"${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/proof-verify"` and
  create it if needed. Before you post, confirm `git status --porcelain` is
  EMPTY; if it is not, something you ran wrote into the tree, so clean it up
  (`git checkout -- .` plus removing the untracked files you created) and
  re-confirm.
- **The steps.** Replay what the record says, exactly as it says it. If a
  step does not work, that is the RESULT — do not rewrite it into one that
  does, do not substitute an equivalent command, and do not fill in a detail
  the step left out. A replay that repairs its own input proves nothing
  about the record that was published.
- **The Definition of Done.** It is the yardstick, not your draft. If you
  believe an assertion is wrong or ungradeable, say so in your final reply;
  never restate, narrow or widen it in your record.

## Step 1 — read the LATEST captured record

Find this item's pull request and read its most recent `Proof of Done —
captured — …` comment:

    gh pr list --head <publish branch> --state open --json number
    gh pr view <number> --json comments

Take the LATEST captured record, not the first. Every accepted review-fix
round re-earns a green janitor and therefore re-captures, so an older record
describes a tree that no longer exists.

Each `- ` bullet of the `## Definition of Done` section is one assertion.
The declaration is POSITIONAL.
Bullets under a `### Host-captured` sub-heading have proof mode
`host_captured`; bullets under a `### Human-attested` sub-heading have proof
mode `human_attested`; every other bullet has proof mode `factory_captured`.

You replay ONLY the `factory_captured` assertions, and you replay EVERY one
of them. An agent session on an operator host records and replays the
`host_captured` ones against the released build after merge, and a human
attests the `human_attested` ones on the same pull request later; you MUST
still list both kinds in your own record, under the TWO SEPARATE headings
named in Step 5.

Read those modes off the Definition of Done YOURSELF rather than trusting
the captured record's labels. Being a stranger to the capture is the whole
value of this leg, and a mode is exactly the kind of thing the capture can
have got wrong.

Keep the section's own order. You publish per assertion in **Definition of
Done order**, exactly as the captured record does, because the post-merge
acceptance pass indexes your record against that order.

If the pull request carries NO captured record at all, do not improvise one:
that is the blocked case in the last section.

## Step 2 — replay every step verbatim

For each `factory_captured` assertion, execute its numbered steps
**verbatim**, in order, exactly as the record wrote them.

- Where a step needs a credential, it names it by its
  **environment-variable name** and names the wrapper that supplies it —
  **never a value**. Use the variable. Your own record must do the same: a
  credential value, or a fragment of one, or a command whose output would
  print one, must appear nowhere.
- Compare what you observe against what the step says to expect. An
  observation that differs from the stated expectation is a
  NON-REPRODUCTION, however plausible the difference looks.
- A step that is ambiguous, incomplete, or impossible to follow as written
  is also a non-reproduction. Record what the step said and where you could
  not follow it.
- **Never reconstruct a missing program.** When a step runs a program — a
  heredoc into an interpreter, a script, a `-c` one-liner, a patch — and the
  record publishes the invocation and the OUTPUT but not the program's
  source, you may not infer that source from the output, from the prose, or
  from the repository. That step is a non-reproduction; grade it so, and put
  the missing source in the finding. Rebuilding it would make your replay a
  test of a program YOU wrote, which proves nothing about the one the
  capture ran — and it would report a green that no later replay can earn.

## Step 3 — capture your own proof

Capture per assertion the same way the record did — a screenshot for
anything reachable through a web interface, a terminal capture for
text-only behaviour — so a reader can set your proof beside the capture's.

Write each image into the scratch directory under this EXACT name:

    <work-item-id>__<run-id>__verify__<NN>__<slug>.<ext>

where `NN` is the two-digit ordinal the replayed step NAMES as the proof it
produces, and `slug` is a short lowercase-kebab description. The ordinal is
load-bearing: your `__verify__` asset is compared to the capture's
`__capture__` asset of the SAME ordinal, so reusing the step's ordinal is
what makes the two comparable at all. Resolve the run id in this order and
use the first that answers: `$FABRO_RUN_ID`, else `git config --get
livespec.factoryRunId`. If neither answers, STOP and end with the
needs-human protocol rather than inventing one.

Upload each image to the repository's standing proof-assets prerelease and
keep the URL it returns:

    gh release upload "$LIVESPEC_PROOF_ASSETS_RELEASE_TAG" \
      "${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/proof-verify/<asset-name>" --clobber

Proof binaries **MUST NOT be committed** to the repository tree; the release
asset store is the only place they live.

How the image is REFERENCED in the record depends on what the Dispatcher
measured for this repository and projected as
`$LIVESPEC_PROOF_ASSET_RENDERING`:

- `inline` — reference it inline so an authorized viewer sees the image in
  the comment: `![<slug> (proof NN)](<asset url>)`.
- `authenticated_link` — the inline half is waived for this repository.
  Reference it as ONE authenticated link per image instead:
  `[<slug> (proof NN) — authenticated link](<asset url>)`.

Use whichever the variable says; do not decide it yourself. When the
variable is ABSENT, use `authenticated_link` — an unset value means no
visibility measurement reached this run, and of the two forms only the
inline one can publish a reference that leaks from a repository nobody
established was public. Say in your final reply that you took the fallback.

### Keep the record within its size budget

Your record is ONE forge comment, and the forge enforces a ceiling on it. A
record the forge REJECTS is a LOST proof that reads downstream as an ABSENT
one: the acceptance pass finds no record and reports every assertion
unevidenced, so a replay that genuinely reproduced everything parks the item
anyway, on a refusal naming the missing record rather than the size.

Three declared numbers bound this, all in **UTF-8 BYTES**, never characters:

- **262144 bytes** — the measured, enforced forge comment ceiling.
- **196608 bytes** — the declared record budget. Stay under it.
- **32768 bytes** — the per-assertion **inline allowance**: what ONE
  assertion's proof may spend inline before it must travel as an attachment.

Do not take the forge's own word for the ceiling. Its rejection message
reads `Body is too long (maximum is 65536 characters)`, and that message is
wrong in BOTH its number and its unit — the enforced ceiling is four times
it, and it counts bytes. The figures above were measured against live
GitHub; the measurement and its controls are in
`plan/definition-and-proof-of-done/research/005-forge-comment-ceiling-measurement-2026-10-07.md`.

Measure in BYTES. `wc -c` counts bytes; `wc -m` counts characters, and on
multibyte proof the two differ by up to a factor of four, in the direction
that loses the proof.

**When your own replay output exceeds the inline allowance, attach it** —
exactly as the capture stage does, with the same four plain lines and the
same digest-bearing name, carrying `verify` where the capture carries
`capture`:

    <work-item-id>__<run-id>__verify__<NN>__proof-sha256-<first 16 hex>.txt

    Attached proof: <asset name>
    Attached proof bytes: <byte size>
    Attached proof digest: sha256:<hex digest>
    Attached proof asset: <asset url>

Compute both from the file you upload, never from the terminal buffer:

    sha256sum "<file>" | cut -d' ' -f1
    wc -c < "<file>"

Never truncate a proof to fit, and never drop an assertion to fit. A
truncated proof is a proof of something else, and a dropped assertion reads
downstream as unevidenced.

**MEASURE THE BODY FILE BEFORE YOU POST IT, and refuse to post it over
budget:** `wc -c < <file>`. If that is more than **196608** bytes, do NOT
post — attach the largest proofs and re-measure until it fits. The
measurement goes before the post because a record comment MUST NOT be
edited after posting: a body already posted is one you can
no longer withhold, and a rejected post leaves nothing behind to read at
all. Report the measured size, the budget, and the assertion whose proof
overflowed.

### A capture whose proof is itself attached

Where the record you are replaying carries `Attached proof:` lines in place
of a fenced block, the capture's evidence lives in that asset, so reading the
record alone does not show you what to compare against. **Fetch it and
verify its digest before you compare:**

    gh release download "$LIVESPEC_PROOF_ASSETS_RELEASE_TAG" \
      --pattern "<asset name>" --dir "${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/proof-verify" --clobber
    sha256sum "${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/proof-verify/<asset name>" | cut -d' ' -f1

Compare that digest to the `Attached proof digest:` the record states.

- **Digest matches** — those are the capture's real bytes. Compare your
  replay output against them and grade the assertion normally.
- **Asset missing, or digest does NOT match** — the capture's evidence
  cannot be read, so there is nothing to have reproduced. Grade that
  assertion a **non-reproduction**, and put the asset name, the digest the
  record states, and what you observed instead into the finding. Do NOT
  grade it reproduced on the strength of the record's prose: a mismatched
  digest means those are not the bytes the capture measured, and a missing
  asset means they are not anywhere.

## Step 4 — decide the verdict

There are exactly two:

- **`verified`** — every `factory_captured` assertion reproduced. Every one:
  one assertion you could not reproduce is enough to deny this verdict, and
  an assertion you did not reach is not an assertion that reproduced.
- **`not_reproduced`** — at least one did not. Name EACH assertion that did
  not reproduce, the step it failed at, and what you observed instead.

`host_captured` and `human_attested` assertions never affect the verdict;
they are listed as pending — under their two separate headings — not graded.
A captured record that lists a host-captured assertion as pending the host
leg has NOT thereby discharged any `factory_captured` assertion, and the
verdict you publish is about the factory ones alone.

### An INCOMPLETE factory proof record is `not_reproduced`

A record that leaves a `factory_captured` assertion with no capture —
absent from the record entirely, or present with no reproduction steps and
no proof — is an **INCOMPLETE factory proof record**. Name that assertion
on a `not_reproduced` record. An assertion you did not reach is not an
assertion that reproduced, so it denies `verified` exactly as a failed
replay does, and `not_reproduced` is also the route that RECOVERS: it
reaches `fix`, which re-earns a green janitor and re-enters
`proof_capture`, so the capture that was missing is actually taken.

Judge this against the Definition of Done you parsed in Step 1, never
against the set of assertions the record happens to list, because an
assertion the record omits is invisible to any check that reads only the
record. A correctly pending host-captured or human-attested assertion is
NOT this shape — those are legitimately uncaptured, and a record carrying
them is complete when every factory assertion is captured.

### The one record shape that earns NEITHER verdict

A record whose proof of a behavioural assertion is **test-suite output
alone** gets no verdict from you at all. This is the ONLY shape that earns
neither; an incomplete record is `not_reproduced` per the section above.
The reviewer is supposed to have blocked it; you are the backstop for the
case where it got through.

End through the structured needs-human ending naming that assertion, as a
JSON object on the last line of your reply:

    {"outcome": "failed", "failure_reason": "<the assertion; that its published proof is test-suite output alone and exercises no behaviour>"}

You **MUST NOT publish `not_reproduced`** for it and you **MUST NOT publish
`verified`** for it. Both are wrong, in opposite directions, because the
**defect is in the record and not in the tree**: `not_reproduced` routes to
`fix` and sends an implementer to repair code that may be perfectly correct,
while `verified` certifies a behaviour nobody exercised and lets it reach
`pr`. Replaying the suite run faithfully — which you could — would produce
the same passing output and prove the same nothing.

Keep this NARROW. It fires on the published record's SHAPE, never on a replay
that went badly: a step you could not follow, an observation that differed
from the stated expectation, a missing program source **is still
`not_reproduced`**, exactly as before. Reading this section as "anything I
cannot reproduce rests the item" would retire that verdict and the fix loop
with it. An assertion with no published capture at all is NOT this shape
either — that is the `not_reproduced` case above, and routing it here would
rest an item the fix loop could have closed.

## Step 5 — publish the record

Post exactly **one NEW comment** on this item's pull request, with
`gh pr comment <number> --body-file <file>`.

A record comment **MUST NOT be edited after posting**; if you get it wrong,
post a new record rather than editing the old one. Do not delete or edit any
earlier record, including the capture's.

The comment's FIRST LINE must be exactly one of these, rendering the verdict
verbatim:

    Proof of Done — verified — run <run-id> — <UTC timestamp>
    Proof of Done — not_reproduced — run <run-id> — <UTC timestamp>

using the run id you resolved in Step 3 and an ISO-8601 UTC timestamp.

The SECOND line must declare, exactly once, the publish-branch head YOUR
replay ran on:

    Publish-branch head: <the full 40-character commit sha of HEAD>

Read it with `git rev-parse HEAD` in the sandbox clone and paste the full
sha — your own reading, never the one the captured record declares, even
when the two agree. It is what lets a later `resume` finish this run from
this pull request instead of re-implementing it, and the resume compares it
against the pull request's current head. Declare it in PROSE, outside every
fenced block. Your replay re-prints the captured record's own lines, this
label among them, so a fenced occurrence is proof OUTPUT and is
deliberately ignored — and naming two different shas in prose makes the
record anchor nothing.

The body then carries, **per assertion in Definition of Done order**:

1. The assertion text, verbatim.
2. Its proof mode.
3. The numbered reproduction steps you replayed, verbatim as the captured
   record published them.
4. Your own proof — an inline image reference (or authenticated link, per
   Step 3) for each screenshot, and a fenced code block for each text
   capture.
5. Whether that assertion reproduced. On a `not_reproduced` record this is
   the load-bearing line: the acceptance pass reads it per assertion.

When this item has any `host_captured` assertions, the record MUST also
carry a heading stating that those assertions are **pending the host leg**,
listing each of them. When it has any `human_attested` assertions, the
record MUST carry a SEPARATE heading stating that those are **pending human
attestation**, listing each of them. Where the item has both, both headings
appear; they name different legs, owed by different parties, and the
pointer and the post-merge acceptance pass read THIS record to decide what
the item is still waiting on.

A worked shape, for an item with one reproducing assertion and one that did
not:

    Proof of Done — not_reproduced — run 01M3EXAMPLERUNID — 2026-10-01T09:00:00Z

    ## Assertion 1 — `list-work-items --json` projects the `parent` field.

    Proof mode: `factory_captured`

    Reproduction steps, as published:

    1. From the clone root, run
       `uv run livespec-orchestrator-beads-fabro-list-work-items --json`.
       Produces proof 01.
    2. Confirm every record in the emitted array carries a `parent` key.

    Proof 01:

    ```
    $ uv run ... --json | python -c 'import json,sys; ...'
    all 638 records carry parent
    ```

    Reproduced: yes.

    ## Assertion 2 — The console renders the capacity banner.

    Proof mode: `factory_captured`

    Reproduction steps, as published:

    1. Start the console with `… --port 8099`; requires `$GITHUB_TOKEN`,
       supplied by the run's credential projection.
    2. Screenshot `http://127.0.0.1:8099/runs` headlessly. Produces proof 02.

    Proof 02:

    ![runs-page (proof 02)](<asset url>)

    Reproduced: NO. Step 2 renders the runs page with no capacity banner;
    the captured proof 02 shows one.

## Step 6 — route the verdict

Report, in your final reply: the pull request number, the comment id or URL
of the record you posted, each asset name you uploaded, the verdict, and the
confirmation that `git status --porcelain` was empty. Report any deviation
verbatim.

Then end your reply with a single JSON object on the LAST line:

- verdict `verified`:        `{"preferred_next_label": "approve"}`
- verdict `not_reproduced`:  `{"preferred_next_label": "fix"}`

Use those exact lowercase tokens. `approve` is the ONLY label that reaches
the `pr` node, and it is a conditional edge: nothing publishes on a verdict
other than `verified`. `fix` routes to the `fix` node, where a code change
belongs; the loop then re-earns a green janitor, re-captures, is re-reviewed
and returns here. That return is bounded — a third non-reproduction routes to
the `non_converged` terminal and the Dispatcher marks the slice
`needs-regroom` — so do NOT soften a verdict to keep the loop alive. A
slice that cannot converge is supposed to say so.

## When the replay is blocked (needs-human protocol)

A verdict is a REPLAY RESULT. When you could not replay at all — no pull
request on the publish branch, no captured record on it, no run id
resolvable, no `$LIVESPEC_PROOF_ASSETS_RELEASE_TAG` value, the asset upload
refused, `gh` auth failure — that is not `not_reproduced`, because nothing
was tested and routing it to `fix` would send the implementer to repair code
that may be perfectly correct. End your final reply with the failed outcome
and a STRUCTURED reason, as a JSON object on the last line:

    {"outcome": "failed", "failure_reason": "<what is blocked; what you tried; what decision is needed>"}

The graph routes a failed outcome to the terminal `needs_human` node: the
run preserves the tree on a run-scoped ref and ends, and the work-item rests
in the ledger at `blocked / needs-human` until a human decides.

## Ending the turn — leave nothing running in the background

The ACP turn this stage runs inside cannot COMPLETE while the agent
session still has work outstanding, so anything you leave running holds
the turn open until the node's own timeout kills it — and work that had
already finished is then recorded as a timed-out stage instead of the
green result it was. Measured repeatedly on this factory: stages that had
already emitted their final message sat idle for 28, 75 and 89 minutes
before the ceiling fired, and four further runs were lost in one night to
a single backgrounded command.

So, in this stage:

- NEVER background a tool call. Do not pass `run_in_background` (or any
  other detach flag) to a shell tool, and do not start a poller, a
  watcher, a `tail -f`, or a loop that waits for a condition.
- Run a long command in the FOREGROUND and raise THAT call's own timeout
  instead. A full check suite, a dependency install, or a long
  verification wait belongs in ONE blocking call whose output you read,
  never in a background job you poll.
- If something IS still running when you are ready to finish, STOP it
  before your final message (`TaskStop`, `KillShell`, or whatever kills
  what you started) and confirm it is gone.
- Your final message must be the LAST thing the turn does. Do not start
  any new tool call, probe, or cleanup after it.
