# PR stage — publish the work and arm auto-merge

The janitor gate is green. Publish this sandbox clone's committed work
as a PR per the family merge discipline. You are on a Fabro-managed run
branch — its name is run-internal and MUST NOT be published; the PR
rides a feature branch named after the work-item instead.

## Where you are

You are in the SAME isolated Fabro sandbox clone the implement/janitor
stages produced the committed work in — your CURRENT WORKING DIRECTORY
is that clone. Run every `git` and `gh` command here, in the current
directory. Plain `git` is correct here: the sandbox's prepare chain
installed the repository's hooks and they fire on every git write —
never pass `--no-verify`. The assignment below may mention a `Repo:` path: that is the
dispatcher's host-side checkout, it does NOT exist in this sandbox, and
you must NEVER `cd` to it or treat the absence of any such path as
"no committed work". The committed work is reachable as
`git log --oneline origin/{{ inputs.default_branch }}..HEAD` from where you already are.

## Your assignment (for the PR description)

{{ goal }}

## What to do, in order

1. Re-enter the plugin-cache gate BEFORE anything else, and run it exactly
   as written, from this sandbox:

       python3 "${LIVESPEC_SANDBOX_CLAUDE_PLUGINS_ROOT:-$HOME/.claude/plugins}/livespec-run-plugin-gate.py"

   The run's prepare step verified the sandbox's Claude plugin registry and
   recorded the build every stage of this run resolves. THIS session started
   after that, and starting it ran a plugin update of its own, so the registry
   you are about to push under is not necessarily the one the janitor gate
   passed against. The gate reverts any build this run did not start with and
   removes any registered build whose cache never fully materialized. Both are
   silent on stdout; the exit code is the contract.
   - Exit 0: continue to the next step. Lines on stderr naming
     `LIVESPEC_PLUGIN_BUILD_ADVANCED` or `LIVESPEC_PLUGIN_CACHE_UNMATERIALIZED`
     mean it repaired something — report them in your final reply, but they do
     NOT block publishing.
   - Non-zero: STOP. The registry names a plugin build whose cache is
     incomplete and which the gate could not repair, so the repository's
     pre-push hook would fail on a plugin root this run never resolved.
     Do NOT push. Report the gate's stderr verbatim and end with the
     needs-human protocol below.
2. Confirm there is committed work: `git log --oneline
   origin/{{ inputs.default_branch }}..HEAD`. If there are zero commits, STOP — reply
   explaining that nothing was produced, and end your reply with
   `{"preferred_next_label": "done"}`.
3. Refresh the base IMMEDIATELY before publishing: run
   `git fetch origin {{ inputs.default_branch }} --quiet`, then run
   `git rebase origin/{{ inputs.default_branch }}`. If the rebase reports
   conflicts you cannot legitimately resolve, report the rebase output
   verbatim and end with the needs-human protocol below. After a
   successful rebase, re-check committed work with
   `git log --oneline origin/{{ inputs.default_branch }}..HEAD`; if there are zero commits,
   STOP as in step 2.
4. Publish under the feature branch named in your assignment (the
   "Publish branch" line — `feat/<work-item-id>`), NEVER under the
   current run branch's own name:
   `git push -u origin HEAD:refs/heads/feat/<work-item-id>`.
   NEVER `--no-verify`; if the pre-push hook fails and you cannot
   legitimately fix the cause, report its output verbatim and end with
   the needs-human protocol below.
   - If the remote rejects the push with the exact signature
     `refusing to allow a GitHub App to create or update workflow .github/workflows/ci.yml without workflows permission`
     (the workflow path is named here only as the quoted rejection
     signature; this stage must not edit files under `.github/workflows/`),
     retry EXACTLY ONCE: run
     `git fetch origin {{ inputs.default_branch }} --quiet`, then
     `git rebase origin/{{ inputs.default_branch }}`, then repeat the same
     `git push -u origin HEAD:refs/heads/feat/<work-item-id>`
     command. If that retry gets the same rejection, or if any other
     push failure occurs during this workflow-permission retry, report
     the output verbatim and end with the needs-human protocol below.
     Do NOT loop and do NOT retry on any different error signature in
     this workflow-permission arm.
   - If the remote rejects the push as `non-fast-forward` for the
     assignment feature branch after the successful rebase above, first
     reconcile only when you can prove the remote branch tip is this
     run's own prior push. Fetch the assignment feature branch, inspect
     the observed remote tip, and verify that the remote-only commits
     are this run's own prior publication. If you cannot prove the
     remote branch tip is this run's own prior push, report the output
     verbatim and end with the needs-human protocol below.
   - When the non-fast-forward branch is proven to be this run's own
     prior publication, retry EXACTLY ONCE with an explicit lease against
     the observed assignment feature-branch tip:
     `git push --force-with-lease=refs/heads/feat/<work-item-id>:<observed-remote-tip> origin HEAD:refs/heads/feat/<work-item-id>`.
     The retry targets only `refs/heads/feat/<work-item-id>`, never the
     current run branch. The lease is what makes this overwrite safe: if
     anyone updated the remote branch after your inspection, the lease
     mismatch rejects the push and preserves the refusal path. A bare
     `--force` push remains forbidden. If the leased retry fails with a
     lease mismatch, or if any other push failure occurs, report the
     output verbatim and end with the needs-human protocol below.
5. Open the PR against `{{ inputs.default_branch }}` with
   `gh pr create --head feat/<work-item-id>` — title from the
   work-item, body drafted from the work-item acceptance criteria in
   the assignment above, and including the work-item id.
   The body MUST end with the line:

   🤖 Generated with [Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code)

6. Read the merge hold for this item: it is `{{ inputs.merge_hold }}`.
   Everything above this step is the same either way — the branch is
   pushed and the pull request is opened while a hold stands. What the
   hold changes is only whether auto-merge is armed.
   - When it is `false`, arm auto-merge with the repository's declared
     merge mode:
     `gh pr merge --{{ inputs.merge_mode }} --auto --delete-branch <pr-url-or-number>`.
   - When it is `true`, the item is under a per-item MERGE HOLD: a
     maintainer wants it implemented now and merged in a window they
     choose. Arm NOTHING — do not run `gh pr merge` at all, in any form.
     The hold is released later by an operator through the
     `set-merge-hold:<work-item-id>:off` valve, which arms the merge from
     the host; it is not yours to release and not yours to work around.
7. VERIFY the pull request is in the state the hold implies:
   `gh pr view --json number,autoMergeRequest,mergeStateStatus`.
   - When the hold is `false`: if `autoMergeRequest` is null, retry the
     arming once and re-verify.
   - When the hold is `true`: `autoMergeRequest` MUST be null. If it is
     NOT null, an auto-merge request exists that must not — report that
     verbatim and end with the needs-human protocol below rather than
     disarming it yourself.
   - If `mergeStateStatus` is `BEHIND`, the repo automation updates the
     branch; if it stays `BEHIND` for more than 10 minutes, report it —
     do NOT attempt a manual update.
8. Do NOT wait for the merge (it lands server-side after CI, or after
   the hold is released), do NOT clean anything up, and do NOT switch
   branches — the Dispatcher owns merge confirmation and the post-merge
   janitor, and Fabro owns this sandbox's lifecycle.
9. Final reply: report the PR number on its own line in exactly this
   form — `PR_NUMBER=<n>` — plus whether auto-merge is armed, and any
   deviation verbatim. When the hold is `true`, report `MERGE_HOLD=held`
   on its own line beside that PR-number line, so a reader of the reply
   can tell a deliberately unarmed pull request from an arming that
   failed.

## When publishing is blocked (needs-human protocol)

If the push or PR flow is blocked in a way you cannot legitimately
resolve (hook rejection you must not bypass, gh/auth failure, branch
protection surprise), end your final reply with the failed outcome and
a STRUCTURED reason, as a JSON object on the last line:

    {"outcome": "failed", "failure_reason": "<what is blocked; what you tried; what decision is needed>"}

The graph routes a failed outcome to a terminal `needs_human` node: the
run preserves the tree on a run-scoped ref and ends, and the work-item
rests in the ledger at `blocked / needs-human` until a human decides.
